\title{The Timed Plactic Monoid}

\begin{document}
\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
  The plactic monoid is a fundamental algebraic structure that lies at the crossroads of the theory of symmetric polynomials, enumerative geometry, representation theory, and combinatorics.
  It was introduced by Lascoux and Sch\"utzenberger, who used it to prove the Littlewood-Richardson rule.
  It is the quotient of the conncatenation monoid of words in a totally ordered langauge modulo a pair of relations discovered by Knuth.
  Timed words were introduced by Adur and Dill in the context of timed automata, which model the behavior of real-time computer systems.
  In a timed word, each letter in the alphabet occurs for a real-valued duration of time, rather than discretely.
  Finite length timed words form a monoid under concatenation.
  This monoid contains the monoid of words as a submonoid.
  In this article, we extend the definition of the plactic monoid to include timed words by presenting timed analogs of Knuth relations.
  We extend some basic results from the theory of plactic monoids, such as Greene's theorem and the RSK correspondence to timed words.

\section{Tableaux, Insertion, and Greene's Theorem}
\label{sec:tabl-insert-green}
\subsection{Tableaux}
\label{sec:tableaux}
Recall that a partition is a tuple $\lambda=(\lambda_1,\dotsc,\lambda_l)$ of integers such that $\lambda_1\geq \dotsb\geq \lambda_l>0$.
The Young diagram of the partition $\lambda$ is defined as the array of points
\begin{displaymath}
Y(\lambda)=\{(i,j)\mid 1\leq i\leq l,\;1\leq j\leq \lambda_i\}
\end{displaymath}
drawn in matrix notation, so that the point $(i,j)$ lies in the $i$th row and $j$th column of $Y(\lambda)$.
Let $A_n=\{1,\dotsc,n\}$.
\begin{definition}
  A semistandard Young tableau\footnote{It is customary to write the plural of \emph{tableau} as \emph{tableaux}, following French conventions.} in $A_n$ of shape $\lambda$ is an assignment $t:Y(\lambda)\to A_n$ such that the numbers increase weakly from left to right along each row, and increase strictly from top to bottom along each column.
  The weight of $t$ is the tuple $(m_1,\dotsc, m_n)$, where $m_i$ is the number of times that $i$ occurs in the image of $t$.
\end{definition}
For brevity, a semistandard Young tableaux will be referred to as a tableau in the rest of this article.
\begin{example}
  \label{example:ssyt}
  The following is a tableau of shape $(5,2,1)$ and weight $(2,1,4,1)$ in $A_4$:
  \begin{displaymath}
    t=\ytableaushort{11333,24,3}
  \end{displaymath}
\end{example}
We denote by $\Tab_n$ the set of all tableaux in $A_n$, $\Tab_n(\lambda)$ the set of all tableaux of shape $\lambda$ in $A_n$, and by $\Tab(\lambda,\mu)$ the set of all tableaux of shape $\lambda$ and weight $\mu$.
\subsection{Row Insertion}
\label{sec:row-insertion}A row of length $k$ is defined to be a weakly increasing sequence $u=c_1c_2\dotsb c_k$ in $A_n$.
Let $R(A_n)$ denote the set of all rows in $A_n$.
Each row of a tableau is a row in the sense of this definition.
For each $u=c_1\dotsb c_k\in R(A_n)$ and $a\in A_n$, define:
\begin{displaymath}
  \rowins(u,c) =
  \begin{cases}
    (\emptyset, c_1\dotsb c_k c) & \text{if } c_k\leq c,\\
    (c_j,c_1\dotsb c_{j-1}cc_{j+1}\dotsb c_k) & \text{otherwise, with}\\
    & j=\min\{i\mid c<c_i\}.
  \end{cases}
\end{displaymath}
Here $\emptyset$ should be thought of as an empty row of length zero.
\begin{example}
  $\rowins(11333,3) = (\emptyset,113333)$, $\rowins(11333,2)=(3,11233)$.
\end{example}
It is clear from the construction that, for any $u\in R(A_n)$ and $c\in A_n$, if $(c',u')=\rowins(u,c)$, then $u'$ is again a row.
For convenience set $\rowins(u,\emptyset)=(\emptyset,u)$.
\subsection{Tableau Insertion}
\label{sec:tableau-insertion}
Let $t$ be a tableau with rows $u_1,u_2,\dotsc, u_l$.
Then $\ins(t,c)$, the insertion of $a$ into $t$, is defined as follows: first $a$ is inserted into $u_1$; if $\rowins(u_1,c)=(c_1',u_1')$, then $u_1$ is replaced by $u_1'$.
Then $c_1'$ is inserted into $u_2$; if $\rowins(u_2,c_1')=(c_2',u_3)$, then $u_2$ is replaced by $u_2'$, and so on.
This process continues, generating $c_1',c_2',\dotsc,c_k'$ and $u_1',\dotsc,u_k'$.
The tableau $t'=\ins(t,a)$ has rows $u_1',\dotsc,u_k'$, and a last row (possibly empty) consisting of $c_k'$.
It turns out that $\ins(t,c)$ is a tableau (see \cite{knuth}).
\begin{example}
  \label{example:insertion}
  For $t$ as in Example~\ref{example:insertion}, we have
  \begin{displaymath}
    \ins(t,2) = \ytableaushort{11233,23,34},
  \end{displaymath}
  since $\rowins(11333,2)=(3,11233)$, $\rowins(24,3)=(4,23)$, and $\rowins(3,4)=(\emptyset, 34)$.
\end{example}
\subsection{Insertion Tableau of a Word}
\label{sec:insert-tabl-word}
An arbitrary sequence $c_1\dotsb c_k$ in $A_n$ will be called a word in $A_n$.
The set of all words in $A_n$ is denoted by $A_n^*$.
This set may be regarded as a monoid under concatenation, with identity element as the empty word, denoted by $\emptyset$.
\begin{definition}
\label{definition:insertion-tableau}
The insertion tableau $P(w)$ of a word $w$ is defined recursively as:
\begin{align}
  P(\emptyset)&=\emptyset\\
  P(c_1\dotsb c_k)&=\ins(P(c_1\dotsb c_{k-1}), c_k).
\end{align}
\end{definition}
\begin{example}
  \label{example:insertion-tableau}
  Take $w=133324132$.
  Then using Definition~\ref{definition:insertion-tableau}, then sequentially inserting the terms of $w$ into the empty tableau $\emptyset$ gives the sequence of tableaux:
  \begin{displaymath}
    \ytableausetup{smalltableaux}
    \ytableaushort{1},\ytableaushort{13},\ytableaushort{133},\ytableaushort{1333},\ytableaushort{1233,3},\ytableaushort{12334,3},\ytableaushort{11334,2,3},\ytableaushort{11333,24,3},
  \end{displaymath}
  and finally, the insertion tableau $P(w)=\ytableaushort{11233,23,34}$.
\end{example}
\subsection{Greene's Theorem}
\label{sec:words}
Given a word $w=c_1c_2\dotsb c_l$, a subword is a word of the form
\begin{displaymath}
  v = c_{i_1}c_{i_2}\dotsb c_{i_k},
\end{displaymath}
for some $1\leq i_1<i_2<\dotsb < i_k\leq l$.
We say that the subword $v$ is a row if $c_{i_1}\leq c_{i_2}\leq\dotsb\leq c_{i_k}$.
The subword $v$ as above is said to be disjoint from a subword $u=c_{j_1} c_{j_2}\dotsb c_{j_h}$ if the sets $\{i_1,i_2,\dotsc,i_k\}$ and $\{j_1,j_2,\dotsc,j_h\}$ of indices are disjoint.

Given a word $w$, its $k$th Greene invariant \emph{Greene invariant} $a_k(w)$ are defined as the maximal cardinality of a union of $k$ pairwise disjoint row subwords.

Schensted~\cite{schensted} showed that the first Greene invariant $a_1(w)$ of a word is the length of the first row of its insertion tableau $P(w)$.
For instance, the word $w$ from Example~\ref{example:insertion-tableau} has longest increasing row subword of length $5$, and its insertion tableau has first row of length $5$.
His theorem was generalized by Curtis Greene:
\begin{theorem}
  [Greene~\cite{Greene-schen}]
  \label{theorem:Greene}
  For any $w\in A_k$, suppose that the insertion tableau $P(w)$ has $l$ rows of length $\lambda_1,\dotsc,\lambda_l$.
  Then, for each $k=1,\dotsc,l$, $a_l(w)=\lambda_1+\dotsb + \lambda_k$.
\end{theorem}
\subsection{Knuth Relations and the Plactic Monoid}
\label{sec:knuth-equivalence}
The most elegant proof of Greene's theorem (Theorem~\ref{theorem:Greene}) proceeds via the notions of Knuth equivalence and the plactic monoid (see \cite{Lascoux}).

The plactic monoid $\pl_0(A_n)$ is the quotient of the monoid $A_n^*$ by the submonoid generated by the Knuth relations:
\begin{gather}
  \tag{$K1$}\label{eq:k1}
  xzy \equiv zxy \text{ if } x\leq y < z,
  \\
  \tag{$K2$}\label{eq:k2}
  yxz \equiv yzx \text{ if } x < y \leq z.
\end{gather}
On a more concrete level, it is the set of words $w\in A_n$ modulo Knuth equivalence, were words $v$ and $w$ are said to be Knuth equivelent if $w$ can be obtained from $v$ by a sequence of moves of the form (\ref{eq:k1}) and (\ref{eq:k2}) involving any three letters of the words obtained at each stage.
For example,
\begin{displaymath}
  113\rc{332}\equiv_{K2} 11\rc{332}3\equiv_{K2} 1\rc{132}33 \equiv_{K1} \rc{131}233 \equiv_{K1} 311233.
\end{displaymath}
At each stage, the letters to which the Knuth moves will be applied to obtain the next stage are highlighted.
\begin{definition}
  If $t$ is a tableau with rows $u_1,\dotsc,u_l$, then its reading word is obtained by concatenating its rows, starting from bottom to top: $\rd(t) = u_lu_{l-1}\dotsb u_1$.
\end{definition}
\begin{example}
  The reading word of the tableau $t$ from Example~\ref{example:ssyt} is $32411333$.
\end{example}
A tableau is easily recovered from the reading word.
Line breaks are inserted after each letter that is followed by a strictly smaller one.
For example, $32411333$ is broken as $3/24/1133$, recovering the rows of the tableau $t$.
However, it is easy to construct examples of words which are not reading words of tableau.
Thus $\rd:\Tab_n\to A_n^*$ is an injective function.
Following Lascoux, Leclerc and Thibon \cite{Lascoux} tableaux are identified with their reading words, and a word in $A_n^*$ is called a tableau if it lies in the image of $\rd$.
\begin{theorem}
  \label{theorem:unique-tab}
  Every word $w\in A_n^*$ is Knuth equivalent to the reading word of $P(w)$.
  Moreover, if $t,t'\in \Tab_n$ have $\rd(t)\equiv \rd(t')$, then $t=t'$.
  Consequently, $P(w)$ is the unique tableau in the Knuth-equivalence class of $w$.
\end{theorem}
The plactic proof of Greene's theorem proceeds via Theorem~\ref{theorem:unique-tab}---it is easy so see that Greene invariants are unchanged under Knuth moves, and that if $t\in \Tab_n(\lambda)$, where $\lambda=(\lambda_1,\dotsc,\lambda_l)$, then
\begin{displaymath}
  a_k(\rd(t)) = \lambda_1+\dotsb +\lambda_k\text{ for }k=1,\dotsc,l.
\end{displaymath}
Theorems \ref{theorem:Greene} and~\ref{theorem:unique-tab} are special cases of their timed versions which will be proved in Section~\ref{sec:timed-vers-green}, inspired by the proof in \cite{Lascoux}.
\section{A Timed Version of Greene's Theorem}
\label{sec:timed-vers-green}
\subsection{Timed Tableaux}
\label{sec:timed-tableaux}
\begin{definition}
  [Timed Word]
  \label{definition:timed-word}
  A timed word of length $r$ in the alphabet $A$ is a peicewise-constant right-continuous function $w:[0,r)\to A_n$.
  We write $l(w)=r$.
  In other words, for some finite sequence $0=r_0<r_1<\dotsc<r_k=r$ of transition points, and letters $c_1,\dotsc, c_k$ in $A$, $w(x) = c_i$ if $r_{i-1}\leq x < r_i$.
  Given such a function, we write
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:exp_not}
    w = c_1^{t_1} c_2^{t_2}\dotsb c_k^{t_k}, \text{ },
  \end{equation}
  where $t_i = r_i-r_{i-1}$.
  We call this the \emph{exponential string} for $w$.
\end{definition}
The exponential string, as defined above, is not unique; if two successive letters $c_i$ and $c_{i+1}$ are equal, then we can merge them, replacing $c_i^{t_i}c_{i+1}^{t_{i+1}} = c_i^{t_i+t_{i+1}}$.

The above definition is a finite variant of Definition~3.1 of Alur and Dill~\cite{alur-dill}, where $r=\infty$, and there is an infinite increasing sequence of transition points.

Given timed words $w_1$ and $w_2$, their \emph{concatenation} is defined in the most obvious manner---their exponential strings are concatenated (and if necessary, successive equal values merged).
The monoid formed by all timed words in an alphabet $A$, with product defined by concatenation, will be denoted by $A^\dagger$.
We take $A$ to be $A_n=\{1,\dotsc,n\}$.
The submonoid of $A_n^\dagger$ consisting of timed words where the exponents $t_1,t_2,\dotsc,t_k$ in exponential string (\ref{eq:exp_not}) are integers is the free monoid $A_n^*$ from Section~\ref{sec:tabl-insert-green}.
In fact, all definitions and theorems in this section will specialize to those of Section~\ref{sec:tabl-insert-green} when the exponents are integral.

\begin{definition}
  [Timed Subword]
  \label{definition:timed-subword}
  Given a timed word $w:[0,r)\to A_n$, and $S\subset [0,r)$ a finite disjoint union of intervals of the form $[a, b)\subset [0,r)$, the timed subword of $w$ with respect to $S$ is defined as the timed word:
  \begin{displaymath}
    w_S(t) = w(\inf\{u\in [0,r)\mid \mathrm{meas}([0,u)\cap S) \geq t\}) \text{ for } 0\leq t < \mathrm{meas}(S).
  \end{displaymath}
  Given two words $v$ and $w$, $v$ is said to be a subword of $w$ if there exists $S\subset [0,r)$ as above such that $v=w_S$.
  Subwords $v_1,\dotsc,v_k$ of $w$ are said to be pairwise disjoint if there exist pairwise disjoint subsets $S_1,\dotsc,S_k$ as above such that $v_i=w_{S_i}$ for $i=1,\dotsc,k$.
\end{definition}

A \emph{timed row} is, by definition, a weakly increasing timed word.
Every timed word $w$ has a unique decomposition into rows:
\begin{displaymath}
  w = u_l u_{l-1}\dotsb u_1,
\end{displaymath}
such $u_i$ is a row for each $i=1,\dotsc,l$, and $u_iu_{i-1}$ is not a row for any $i=2,\dotsc,l$.
We shall refer to such a decomposition as the row decomposition of $w$.
Given two rows $u$ and $v$, say that $u$ is dominated by $v$ (denoted $u\lhd v$) if $l(u)\geq l(v)$ and $u(t)<v(t)$ for all $0\leq t<l(v)$.
\begin{definition}[Timed Tableau]\label{definition:timed-tableau}
  A timed tableau in $A_n$ is a timed word $w$ in $A_n$ with row decomposition $w=u_l u_{l-1}\dotsb u_1$ such that $u_1\lhd \dotsb \lhd u_l$.
  The shape of $w$ is the weakly decreasing tuple $(l(u_1),l(u_2),\dotsc,l(u_l))$ of positive real numbers (henceforth called a \emph{real partition}), and the wieght of $w$ is the vector:
  \begin{displaymath}
    \wt(w) = (m_1,\dotsc,m_n),
  \end{displaymath}
where $m_i$ is the Lebesgue measure of the pre-image of $i$ under $t$, i.e., $m_i=\mathrm{meas}(w^{-1}(i))$.
\end{definition}
The above is a direct generalization of the notion of the reading word of a tableau in the sense of Section~\ref{sec:tabl-insert-green}.
\begin{example}
  \label{example:timed-tableau}
  $w=3^{0.8}4^{1.1}1^{1.4}2^{1.6}3^{0.7}$ is a timed tableau in $A_5$ of shape $(3.7,1.9)$ and weight $(1.4, 1.6, 1.5, 1.1,0)$.
\end{example}
\subsection{Timed Insertion}
\label{sec:timed-insertion}
Given a timed word $w$ and $0\leq a < b \leq l(w)$, write $w_{[a, b)}$ for the timed word of length $b-a$ such that
\begin{displaymath}
  w_{[a, b)}(t) = w(a+ t) \text{ for } 0\leq t<b-a.
\end{displaymath}
We call $w_{[a,b)}$ a segment of $w$.
If $a=0$, then $w_{[a,b)}$ is called an initial segment of $w$.
\begin{definition}[Timed row insertion]
  \label{definition:timed-row-insertion}
  Given a timed row $w$, define the insertion $\rowins(w, c^{t_c})$ of $c^{t_c}$ into $w$ as follows: if $w(t)\leq c$ for all $0\leq t < l(u)$, then
  \begin{displaymath}
    \rowins(w, c^{t_c}) = (\emptyset, wc^{t_c}).
  \end{displaymath}
  Otherwise, there exists $0\leq t < l(u)$ such that $w(t)>c$.
  Let
  \begin{displaymath}
    t_0 = \min\{0\leq t< u(l)\mid w(t)> c\}.
  \end{displaymath}
  Define
  \begin{displaymath}
    \rowins(w, c^{t_c}) =
    \begin{cases}
      (w_{[t_0, t_0+t_c)}, w_{[0, t_0)}c^{t_c} w_{[t_0+t_c, l(w))}) & \text{if } l(u) - t_0 > t_c,\\
      (w_{[t_0, l(u))}, w_{[0, t_0)} c^{t_c}) & \text{if } l(u) - t_0 \leq t_c.
    \end{cases}
  \end{displaymath}
  If $u$ is a row of the form $c_1^{t_1}\dotsb c_l^{t_l}$.
  Define $\rowins(w,u)$ by induction on $l$ as follows:
  Having defined $(v',w')=\rowins(w,c_1^{t_1}\dotsb c_{l-1}^{t_{l-1}})$,
  let $(v'',w'')=\rowins(w',c_l^{t_l})$.
  Then define
  \begin{displaymath}
    \rowins(w,u) = (v'v'', w'').
  \end{displaymath}
\end{definition}
\begin{example}
  \label{example:timed-row-ins}
  $\rowins(1^{1.4}2^{1.6}3^{0.7},1^{0.7}2^{0.2})=(2^{0.7}3^{0.2},1^{2.1}2^{1.1}3^{0.5})$.
\end{example}
\begin{definition}
  [Timed Tableau Insertion]
  Let $w$ be a timed tableau with row decomposition $u_l\dotsc u_1$, and let $v$ be a timed row.
  Then $\ins(w, v)$, the insertion of $v$ into $w$ is defined as follows:
  first $v$ is inserted into $u_1$.
  If $\rowins(u_1,v)=(v_1',u_1')$, then $v_1'$ is inserted into $u_2$; if $\rowins(u_2,v_1')=(v_2',u_2')$, then $v_2'$ is inserted in $u_3$, and so on.
  This process continues, generating $v_1',\dotsc,v_l'$ and $u_1',\dotsc,u_l'$.
  $\ins(t,v)$ is defined to be $v_l'u_l'\dotsb u_1'$.
  Note that it is quite possible that $v_l'=\emptyset$.
\end{definition}
\begin{example}
  If $w$ is the timed tableau from Example~\ref{example:timed-tableau}, then
  \begin{displaymath}
    \ins(w,1^{0.7}2^{0.2})=3^{0.7}4^{0.2}2^{0.7}3^{0.3}4^{0.9}1^{2.1}2^{1.1}3^{0.5}.
  \end{displaymath}
\end{example}
\begin{definition}
  Given two real partition $\lambda=(\lambda_1,\dotsc,\lambda_l)$ and $\mu=(\mu_1,\dotsc,\mu_{l-1})$, we say that $\mu$ \emph{interleaves} $\lambda$ if the inequalities
  \begin{displaymath}
    \lambda_1 \geq \mu_1 \geq \lambda_2 \geq \mu_2 \geq \dotsb \geq \lambda_{l-1}\geq \mu_{l-1}\geq \mu_l. 
  \end{displaymath}
  In other words, the successive parts of $\mu$ lie in-between the successive parts of $\lambda$.
\end{definition}
\begin{theorem}
  \label{theorem:tableauness-of-insertion}
  For any timed tableau $w$ in $A_n$ and any timed row $v$ in $A_n$, $\ins(w,v)$ is again a timed tableau in $A_n$.
  We have
  \begin{displaymath}
    \wt(\ins(w,v)) = \wt(w) + \wt(v),
  \end{displaymath}
  and $\shape(w)$ interleaves $\shape(\ins(w,v))$.
\end{theorem}
The proof of Theorem~\ref{theorem:tableauness-of-insertion} can be broken down into three preparatory lemmas:
\begin{lemma}
  \label{lemma:dom1.5}
  Suppose $u$ and $v$ are rows, and $(v',u')=\rowins(u,v)$.
  Then $v\lhd v'$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Going through the cases in Definition~\ref{definition:timed-row-insertion} shows that $v'$ is a concatenation of segments of $u$, each of which is displaced by a term in the exponential string of an initial segment of $v$.
  Moreover, the value of the term in $v$ is stricly less than the minimum value of the segment that it displaces.
  This shows that $v'\lhd v$.
\end{proof}
\begin{lemma}
  \label{lemma:dom1}
  Suppose $u$ and $v$ are rows, and $(v',u')=\rowins(u,v)$.
  Then $u'\lhd v$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  From the argument in the proof of Lemma~\ref{lemma:dom1.5}, it follows that the row $u'$ contains a subword $v''$ that equals the initial segment of $v$ of length $l(v')$.
  By Lemma~\ref{lemma:dom1.5}, $v''(t)<v(t)$ for all $0\leq t<l(v')$, and since $u'$ is a row, and $v''$ is a subword of $u'$, $v''(t)\leq u'(t)$ for all $0\leq t<l(v')$.
  It follows that $u'\lhd v$.
\end{proof}
\begin{lemma}
  \label{lemma:dom2}
  Suppose $u_1\lhd u_2$ and $v_1\lhd v_2$, $(v_1',u_1')=\rowins(u_1,v_1)$, and $(v_2',u_2')=\rowins(u_2,v_2)$.
  Then $u_1'\lhd u_2'$ and $v_1'\lhd v_2'$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem~\ref{theorem:tableauness-of-insertion}]
  Suppose $w$ has row decomposition $u_l\dotsb u_1$.
  Let $(v_1',u_1')=\rowins(u_1,v)$.
  By Lemma~\ref{lemma:dom1}, $v\lhd v_1'$.
  Now suppose $(v_2',u_2')=\rowins(u_2,v_1')$.
  By Lemma~\ref{lemma:dom2}, $v_1'\lhd v_2'$, and $u_1'\lhd u_2'$.
  Continuing in this manner, since $(v_{i+1}',u_{i+1}')=\rowins(u_{i+1},v_i')$, it follows that $u_i'\lhd u_{i+1}'$ for $i=1,\dotsc,l-1$ by induction on $i$.
  Finally, it remains to show that $u_l'\lhd v_l'$, but this follows from Lemma~\ref{lemma:dom1.5}.
\end{proof}
\begin{definition}
  [Insertion Tableau of a Timed Word]
  Let $w$ be a timed word with row decompositon $u_1\dotsb u_l$.
  The insertion tableau of $w$ is defined as:
  \begin{displaymath}
    P(w) = \ins(\dotsb\ins(\ins(u_1, u_2),u_3),\dotsc,u_l).
  \end{displaymath}
\end{definition}
\begin{example}
  If $w=3^{0.8}1^{0.5}4^{1.1}1^{0.9}2^{1.6}3^{0.7}1^{0.7}2^{0.2}$ has four rows in its row decomposition.
  $P(w)$ is calculated via the following steps:
  \begin{displaymath}
    \begin{array}{|l|l|}
      \hline
      w & P(w)\\
      \hline
      3^{0.8} & 3^{0.8}\\
%      3^{0.8}1^{0.5} & 3^{0.5}1^{0.5}3^{0.3}\\

  The first timed Knuth relation is, given timed rows $x$, $y$, and $z$:
  \begin{equation}
    \tag{$\kappa_1$}
    \label{eq:tk1}
    xzy \equiv zxy,
  \end{equation}
  if $xyz$ is a row, $l(z) = l(y)$, and the last letter of $y$ is strictly less than the first letter of $z$.

  The second timed Knuth relation is, given timed rows $x$, $y$, and $z$:
  \begin{equation}
    \tag{$\kappa_2$}
    \label{eq:tk2}
    yxz \equiv yzx,
  \end{equation}
  if $xyz$ is a row, $l(x)=l(y)$, and the last letter of $x$ is strictly less than the first letter of $y$.

  The timed plactic monoid $\pl(A_n)$ is the quotient $A^\dagger/\equiv$, where $\equiv$ is the congruence generated by the timed Knuth relations (\ref{eq:tk1}) and (\ref{eq:tk2}).
\end{definition}
In other words, two elements of $A^\dagger$ are said to differ by a Knuth move if they are of the form $uv_1w$ and $uv_2w$, where $v_1$ and $v_2$ are terms on opposite sides of one of the timed Knuth relations (\ref{eq:tk1}) and (\ref{eq:tk2}).
Knuth equivalence $\equiv$ is the equivalence relation generated by Knuth moves.
Since this equivalence is stable under left and right multiplication in $A^\dagger$, the concatenation product on $A^\dagger$ descends to a product on the set $\pl(A)$ of Knuth equivalence classes, giving it the structure of a monoid.
\begin{lemma}
  \label{lemma:sharp-moves}
  Then $v$ and $w$ differ by a Knuth move (\ref{eq:tk1}) if and only if $v^\sharp$ and $w^\sharp$ (see Definition~\ref{definition:schuetzenberger-involution}) differ by a Knuth move (\ref{eq:tk2}).
\end{lemma}

  When the involution $w\mapsto w^\sharp$ is applied to the Knuth relation (\ref{eq:tk1}), the Knuth relation (\ref{eq:tk2}) is obtained.

\subsection{Greene Invariants for Timed Words}
\label{sec:timed-greene-invar}
\begin{definition}[Greene Invariants for Timed Words]
  \label{definition:timed-Greene-invars}
  Given a word $w\in A_n^\dagger$, its $k$th Greene invariant $a_k(w)$ is defined to be the maximum possible sum of lengths of a set of $k$ pairwise disjoint row subwords of $w$:
  \begin{multline*}
    a_k(w) = \max\{l(u_1)+\dotsb+l(u_k)\mid u_1,\dotsc,u_k \text{ are pairwise disjoint}\\ \text{subwords and each $u_i$ is a row }\}
  \end{multline*}
\end{definition}
\begin{lemma}
  \label{lemma:tableau-shape-greene}
  If $w$ is a timed tableau of shape $\lambda=(\lambda_1,\dotsc,\lambda_l)$, then for each $1\leq k\leq l$,
  \begin{displaymath}
    a_k(w) = \lambda_1+\dotsb + \lambda_k.
  \end{displaymath}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  This proof is very similar to the proof of the corresponding result in \cite{Lascoux}.
  Indeed, $u_1,\dotsc,u_k$ are pairwise disjoint subwords that are rows, so
  \begin{displaymath}
    a_k(w) \geq \lambda_1+\dotsb + \lambda_l.
  \end{displaymath}
  Conversely, any row subword of $w$ will cannot consist of overlapping segments from two different rows $u_i$ and $u_j$ of $w$, because if $i>j$, then $u_i(t)>u_j(t)$, but in the row decomposition of $w$, $u_i$ occurs before $u_j$.
  Therefore, $k$ disjoint subwords can have length at most the sum of lengths of the largest $k$ rows of $w$, which is $\lambda_1+\dotsc+\lambda_k$.
\end{proof}
\begin{lemma}
  \label{lemma:Knuth-Greene}
  If two timed words are Knuth equivalent, then they have the same Greene invariants.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  It suffices to prove that if two words differ by a Knuth move they have the same Greene invariants.
  For the Knuth move (\ref{eq:tk1}), suppose that $xyz$ is a timed row with $l(z)=l(y)$, and the last letter of $y$ is strictly less than the first letter of $z$.
  For any timed words $w$ and $u$, we wish to show that Greene invariants coincide for $wxzyu$ and $wzxyu$.
  Now suppose that $v_1,\dotsc,v_k$ are pairwise disjoint row subwords of $wxzyu$ whose lengths add up to $a_k(wxzyu)$.
  We may write $v_i=w_ix_iz_iy_iu_i$ for each $i$, where $w_i,x_i,z_i,y_i$ and $u_i$ are row subwords of $w,x,z,y$ and $u$ respectively.

  Since the last letter of $y$ is strictly smaller than the first letter of $z$, it cannot be that $y_i\neq \emptyset$ and $z_i\neq \emptyset$ simultaneously for the same $i$.
  Renumber $v_1,\dotsc,v_k$ in such a way that $v_i=w_ix_iz_iu_i$ for $i=1,\dotsc,r$ and $v_i=w_ix_iy_iu_i$ for $i=r+1,\dotsc,k$.
  If $x_i=\emptyset$ for $i=1,\dotsc,r$, then all the $v_i$'s remain row subwords of $wzxyu$, and so $a_k(wzxyu)\geq a_k(wxzyu)$.
  If $y_i=\emptyset$ for $i=r+1,\dotsc,k$, then set
  \begin{align*}
    v_1'&=w_1x_1yu_1,\\
    v_i'&=w_ix_iu_i \text{ for } i=2,\dotsc,k.
  \end{align*}
  Then $v'_i$ are pairwise disjoint row subwords of $wzxyu$, and $l(v'_1)+\dotsb + l(v'_k)\geq l(v_1)+\dotsb l(v_k)$, since $l(y)=l(z)\geq l(z_1)+\dotsb + l(z_r)$.
  It follows that $a_k(wzxyu)\geq a_k(wxzyu)$.

  If at least one $x_i\neq \emptyset$ and one $y_i\neq\emptyset$, assume that $x_1$ has the least first letter among $x_1,\dotsc,x_r$, and that $y_k$ has the largest last letter among $y_{r+1},\dotsc,y_k$.
  Let $x_0$ be the row subword of $x$ obtained by concatenating the segements of $x_1,\dotsc,x_r$ in the order in which they appear in $x$ (so $x_0$ is a row of length $l(x_1)+\dotsb + l(x_r)$).
  Let $y_0$ be the row subword of $y$ obtained by concatenating the segments of $y_{r+1},\dotsc, y_k$ in the order in which they appear in $y$ (so $y_0$is a row of lenght $l(y_{r+1})+\dotsb + l(y_k)$).
  Define
  \begin{align*}
    v'_1 &= w_1x_0y_0u_k\\
    v'_i &= w_iz_iu_i \text{ for }i=2,\dotsc,r,\\
    v'_i &= w_ix_iu_i \text{ for } i=r+1,\dotsc,k,\\
    v'_k &= w_kz_1u_1.
  \end{align*}
  Then $v'_1,\dotsc,v'_k$ are pairwise disjoint row subwords of $wzxyu$ with total length $l(v_1)+\dotsb+l(v_k)$, so $a_k(wzxyu)\geq a_k(wxzyu)$.
  The reverse inequality $a_k(wzxyu)\geq a_k(wxzyu)$ is obvious, since every row subword of $wzxyu$ is also a row subword of $wxzyu$.
  It follows that $a_k(wzxyu)=a_l(wxzyu)$ for all $k$.

  For the Knuth move (\ref{eq:tk2}) a similar argument can be given, however, a more elegant method is to use Lemma~\ref{lemma:sharp-moves}, noting that $a_k(w)=a_k(w^\sharp)$ for all $k\geq 1$ and all $w\in A_n^\dagger$.
\end{proof}
\subsection{Timed Tableaux and Timed Knuth Equivalence}
\label{sec:timed-tableaux-timed-equiv}
\begin{lemma}
  \label{lemma:insertion-and-equivalence}
  Every timed word is Knuth equivalent to its timed insertion tableau.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  It suffices to show that, for every timed row $u$, and every term $c^t$, if $(v,u')=\rowins(u,c^t)$, then $uc^t\equiv vu'$.
  If $u(t)\leq c$ for all $0\leq t<l(u)$, there is nothing to show.
  Otherwise, a segment $v$ of $u$, beginning at $t_0$, and of length $t_1=\min(l(u)-t_0,t)$ is displaced by the segment $c^{t_1}$ of $c^t$.
  Write $u=u'vu''$.
  It suffices to show $u'vu''c^{t_1}\equiv vu'c^{t_1}u''$.
  But this can be done in two Knuth moves as follows (the segment to which the Knuth move is applied is underlined):
  \begin{displaymath}
    u'\underline{v u'' c^t} \equiv_{\kappa_2} u'\underline{vc^tu''} = \underline{u'vc^t}u'' \equiv_{\kappa_1} \underline{vu'c^t}u'',
  \end{displaymath}
  completing the proof of the lemma.
\end{proof}
For any real partition $\lambda$, let $\ttab_n(\lambda)$ denote the set of all timed tableaux in $A_n$ of shape $\lambda$.
Let $\tr_n(r)$ denote the set of timed rows in $A_n$ of length $r$.
Given $w\in A_n^\dagger$, let $\bar w$ denote the word in $A_{n-1}^\dagger$ whose exponential string is obtained by removing all terms of the form $n^t$ with $t>0$ from the exponential string of $w$.
The word $\bar w$ is called the restriction of $w$ to $A_{n-1}$.
\begin{lemma}
  \label{lemma:restriction-interleaf}
  For every timed tableau $w\in A_n^\dagger$, $\shape(\bar w)$ interleaves $\shape(w)$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Suppose $w$ has row decomposition $u_lu_{l-1}\dotsb u_1$.
  Since $n$ is the largest element of $A_n$, we meay write $u_i=u'_in^{t_i}$ for some $t_i\geq 0$.
  Clearly $l(u_i)\geq l(u'_i)$.
  Since $w$ is semistandard, $l(u'_i)\geq l(u_{i+1})$ for $i=1,\dotsc,l-1$. 
  It follows that the shape of $w'$, which is $(l(u'_1),\dotsc,l(u'_l))$ interleaves the shape of $w$, which is $(l(u_1),\dotsc,l(u_l))$.
\end{proof}
\begin{lemma}
  \label{lemma:equivalence-restriction}
  If $v,w\in A_n^\dagger$ are Knuth equivalent, then their restrictions to $A_{n-1}$, $\bar v$ and $\bar w$ are Knuth equivalent in $A_{n-1}$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Applying the restriction to $A_{n-1}$ map $w\mapsto \bar w$ to both sides of the Knuth relation (\ref{eq:tk1}) gives:
  $x\bar z y$ and $\bar z x y$, which are still Knuth equivalent.
\end{proof}
\begin{lemma}
  \label{lemma:uniqueness-in-class}
  If timed tableaux $v$ and $w$ in $A_n^\dagger$ are Knuth equivalent, then $v=w$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  We prove this by induction on $n$.
  The base case, where $n=1$, is trivial.
  Now suppose $v$ and $w$ are Knuth equivalent tableaux in $A_n^\dagger$.
  Since they are Knuth equivalent, they have the same Greene invariants (Theorem~\ref{lemma:Knuth-Greene}).
  Therefore by Lemma~\ref{lemma:tableau-shape-greene}, $v$ and  $w$ have the same shape.
  By Lemma~\ref{lemma:equivalence-restriction}, $\bar v$ and $\bar w$ are Knuth equivalent tableaux.
  By induction $\bar v= \bar w$.
  But $v$ and $w$ are obtained from $\bar v=\bar w$ by adding segments of the form $n^t$ to the rows of the latter to obtain the common shape of $v$ and $w$, and so must be equal too.
\end{proof}
\begin{theorem}
  For any $w\in A_n^\dagger$, $P(w)$ is the unique timed tableau in its timed Knuth equivalence class.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  By Lemma~\ref{lemma:insertion-and-equivalence}, $P(w)$ lies in the timed Knuth equivalence class of $w$.
  By Lemma~\ref{lemma:uniqueness-in-class}, $P(w)$ is the only timed tableau in this class.
\end{proof}
\subsection{The Greene Invariants of a Timed Tableau}
\label{sec:greene-invar-timed}
\begin{lemma}
  Let $w$ be a timed tableau of shape $\lambda=(\lambda_1,\dotsc,\lambda_l)$.
  Then the Greene invariants of $w$ are given by:
  \begin{displaymath}
    a_k(w) = \lambda_1+\dotsb +\lambda_k \text{ for } k=1,\dotsc,l.
  \end{displaymath}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  The proof is similar to that of Theorem~6.2.1 in \cite{Lascoux}.

  If $w$ has row decomposition $u_lu_{l-1}\dotsb u_1$, then the rows $u_1,\dotsc,u_k$ form a set of pairwise disjoint subwords of $w$ which are all rows, and so $a_k(w)\geq \lambda_1+\dotsc+\lambda_k$.

  For the converse, suppose that $v_1,\dotsc, v_k$ are pairwise disjoint row subwords.
  Each $v_i$ in turn can be written as a concatenation $v_{il}\dotsb v_{i1}$ where $v_{ij}$ is a subword of $u_j$.
  In the notation of Definition~\ref{definition:timed-subword}, suppose that $v_{ij}=(u_j)_{S_{ij}}$.
  Then the fact that $v_i$ is a row and the tableau condition (Definition~\ref{definition:timed-tableau}) implies that all of $S_{ij}$ lies strictly to the left of $S_{ij'}$ for $j>j'$.
  Thus $l(v_i)$ cannot exceed the length of any single row of $w$.
  Similarly, the total lengths of $v_1,\dotsc, v_k$ cannot exceed the lengths of $k$ longest rows of $w$.
\end{proof}
\subsection{Greene's Theorem for Timed Words}
\label{sec:green-theor-timed}
We are now ready to prove the main theorem of this section:
\begin{theorem}
  [Gerene's Theorem for Timed Words]
  \label{theorem:timed-Greene}
  Let $w$ be a timed word whose insertion tableau $P(w)$ has shape $\lambda=(\lambda_1,\dotsc,\lambda_l)$.
  Then the Greene invariants of $w$ are given by:
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:Greene-theorem}
    a_k(w) = \lambda_1+\dotsc+\lambda_k, \text{ for } k=1,\dotsc, l.
  \end{equation}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Each timed word $w$ is Knuth equivalent to its insertion tableau $P(w)$ (Lemmas~\ref{sec:timed-tableaux-timed-equiv}).
  But Knuth equivalence preserves Greene invatiants (Lemma~\ref{lemma:Knuth-Greene}), so $w$ and $P(w)$ have the same Greene invariants, so $a_k(w)=a_k(P(w))$ for each $k$.
  By Lemma~\ref{sec:greene-invar-timed}, $a_k(P(w)) = \lambda_1+\dotsb + \lambda_k$, so (\ref{eq:Greene-theorem}) holds.
\end{proof}
\section{The Real RSK Correspondence}
\label{sec:real-rsk-corr}
\subsection{Timed Words Associated to a Matrix}
\label{sec:timed-wds-matrix}
Ley $M_{m\times n}(\RR^+)$ denote the set of all $m\times n$ matrices with non-negative real entries.
To each $A\in M_{m\times n}(\RR^+)$, one can associate two timed words, $u_A\in A_n^\dagger$, and $v_A\in A_m^\dagger$:
\begin{align*}
  u_A & = 1^{a_{11}} 2^{a_{12}}\dotsb n^{a_{1n}}\;1^{a_{21}} 2^{a_{22}}\dotsb n^{a_{2n}}\;\dotsb \;1^{a_{m1}} 2^{a_{m2}}\dotsb n^{a_{mn}}\\
  v_A & = 1^{a_{11}} 2^{a_{21}}\dotsb m^{a_{m1}}\;1^{a_{12}} 2^{a_{22}}\dotsb m^{a_{m2}}\;\dotsb \;1^{a_{1n}} 2^{a_{2n}}\dotsb m^{a_{mn}}.
\end{align*}
\subsection{The Real RSK Correspondence}
\label{sec:real-rsk-corr-subsec}
For each $A\in M_{l\times m}(\RR^+)$, define the real RSK map:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:rrsk}
  RSK(A) = (P(u_A), P(v_A)).
\end{equation}
Given real partitions $\mu=(\mu_1,\dotsc,\mu_m)$ and $\nu=(\nu_1,\dotsc,\nu_n)$, set:
\begin{multline*}
  M_{\mu\nu} = \{A\in M_{m\times n}(\RR)\mid \\
  \sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij} = \mu_i, \sum_{i=1}^m a_{ij}=\nu_j \text{ for }1\leq i \leq m,\; 1\leq j\leq n\}.
\end{multline*}
Since $|\mu|$ and $|\nu|$ are both the sum of all the entries of a matrix in $M_{\mu\nu}$, if $M_{\mu\nu}$ is non-empty, then $|\mu|=|\nu|$.
\begin{theorem}
  \label{theorem:real-rsk}
  The real RSK map (\ref{eq:rrsk}) defines a bijection:
  \begin{displaymath}
    M_{\mu\nu} \tilde{\to} \coprod_\lambda \ttab(\lambda,\nu)\times \ttab(\lambda,\mu).
  \end{displaymath}
  The disjoint union runs over all real partitions $\lambda$ such that $|\lambda|=|\mu|=|\nu|$.
  When $A$ has integer entries, then the real RSK correspondence coincides with the RSK correspondence introduced in \cite[Section~3]{knuth}.
\end{theorem}
It is easy to see that the real RSK map coincides with Knuth's correspondence \cite[Section~3]{knuth}.
For in this case, the tableau $P$ defined by Knuth is the insertion tableau $P(u_A)$ of $u_A$.
Since $v_A = u_{A'}$ (here $A'$ denotes the tranpose of the matrix $A$), by the symmetry property of Knuth's correspodence \cite[Theorem~3]{knuth}, it follows that the tableau $Q$ defined by Knuth must be the tableau $P(v_A)$.
The proof of Theorem~\ref{theorem:real-rsk} will be the 
\subsection{Shape of the Tableaux}
\label{sec:shape-of-tableaux}
The set $[m]\times [n]$ of entries of $A$ has a natural partial order:
\begin{displaymath}
  (i,j)\leq (i',j') \text{ if } i\leq i',\text{ and } j\leq j'.
\end{displaymath}
For every $C\subset [m]\times [n]$, and $A\in M_{m\times n}(\RR^+)$, let $A(C)=\sum_{(i,j)\in C} a_{ij}$.
\begin{definition}
  [Greene invariants of a Real Matrix]
  Let $A\in M_{m\times n}(\RR^+)$.
  The $k$ Greene invariant of $A$ is defined to be:
  \begin{displaymath}
    a_k(A) = \max_C A(C),
  \end{displaymath}
  where the sum is over all $C\subset [m]\times [n]$ which can be written as a union of $k$ chains in $[m]\times[n]$.
  The relationship between Greene invariants of timed words (Definition~\ref{definition:timed-Greene-invars}) and Greene invariants of real matrices is given by the following lemma:
\end{definition}
\begin{lemma}
  \label{lemma:Greene-matrix-word}
  Let $A\in M_{m\times n}(\RR^+)$.
  Then $a_k(u_A)=a_k(A)$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  A timed subword of $u_A$ is of the form:
  \begin{displaymath}
    j_1^{b_{i_1j_1}} j_2^{b_{i_2,j_2}} \dotsb j_r^{b_{i_rj_r}},
  \end{displaymath}
  where $i_1\leq i_2 \dotsb \leq i_r$, and if $i_s=i_t$ for $s<t$, then $j_s\leq j_t$, and $0<b_{i_sj_s}\leq a_{i_sj_s}$.
  Such a timed subword is a timed row if $j_1\leq j_2 \leq \dotsb \leq j_r$.
  Thus chains in $u_A$ come from chains in $[m]\times[n]$, and the lemma follows.
\end{proof}
The map $(i,j)\mapsto (j,i)$ is an isomorphism of posets $[m]\times [n]\to [n]\times [m]$.
Therefore, $a_k(A)=a_k(A')$ for any matrix $A$.
Combining this with the fact that $v_A=u_{A'}$ gives:
\begin{corollary}
  \label{lemma:same-shape}
  For any $A\in M_{m\times n}(\RR^+)$, $P(u_A)$ and $P(v_A)$ have the same shape.
\end{corollary}
